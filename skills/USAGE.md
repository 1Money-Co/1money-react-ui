# Skill usage

Use the following prompts to trigger the repo-local skills. Keep requests
specific and include the component name when applicable.

## Examples
- “Create a new InputCurrency component with stories and tests.”
- “Update Button API to support a new size and refresh snapshots.”
- “Add a Storybook story for Modal with the new prop.”
- “Deprecate Tooltip in favor of Popup and update docs.”
- “Build Storybook docs for a handoff.”
- “Run lint and tests before we ship.”
- “Build the library outputs.”

## Tips
- Mention the component name and desired behavior.
- Call out whether snapshot updates are expected.
- If releasing, specify whether to use `pnpm release` or a manual version.
